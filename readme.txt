This is just (Exactly) a cms customisable as it can be more.
As facebook was made of angry, this is too.

In that perspective that we sometimes need a cms that could do the basic functionality (Render content)
and sometimes we just want to use templates as well but others we need both and honestly
I haven't found anything, so there we go, starting a project to cover that :).

Enjoy, contribute, support. 

MIT licence, I guess... if it changes will be aviced don't worries and also it's just going to affect the following versions
after the chnage :) (Just letting you know, don't mind).

It'll be called Unamed (UnamedCMS) until WE figured out soemthing else.
